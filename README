Create a virtual env. Install packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run training: python train_model.py.

This will download MNIST, train a CNN, and save mnist_cnn.h5.

Run GUI: python gui_predict.py.

Draw a digit using the mouse.

Press Predict to see the model output.

Notes and improvements

Use more epochs or data augmentation for better accuracy.

To support webcam input, capture a frame with OpenCV, convert to grayscale, resize to 28x28, then predict.

You can export the model to SavedModel format or convert to TensorFlow Lite for mobile.
